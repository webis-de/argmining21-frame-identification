In 1990 only 10 percent of House members and 20 percent of senators had served more than 12 years. The problem for the Republican proponents of term limits was that the senior-most members — those who kept getting re-elected over and over — tended to represent rural or small-town districts and they were mostly Democrats. The term-limits advocates were essentially telling rural voters, 'We don't like the people you keep electing to office so we are going to restrict your ability to elect them.' Term limits, for better or worse, have outlived their usefulness to their original advocates. The movement in Oklahoma was driven almost 100 percent by Republicans who wanted to root out entrenched Democrats who they hoped would be replaced by Republicans. That is exactly what happened, and there is no doubt that term limits helped speed the Republican takeover of the Legislature.

A roughly 100-page report prepared by the foreign affairs and defense commission of the Majlis, the Iranian parliament, and dated September 2006 was recently leaked to the French daily Le Monde. The report underscores the vulnerability of the Iranian economy--especially the oil sector--to sanctions. At first glance, it might seem that a country with the second-largest gas and oil reserves in the world has nothing to worry about. But as the report notes, 85 percent of Iran's revenue comes from the sale of oil abroad. At the same time, Iran imports most of the refined products it uses, like gasoline. Iran consumes half a million barrels of petroleum products per day, of which 40 percent is imported, at a cost of $3 to 4 billion a year. Heightening the vulnerability of the Iranian economy to sanctions is the fact that half of its imports come from Western countries, including 40 percent from the European Union. In the event of sanctions, the bulk of Iranian industry would be paralyzed after just three to four months. Iran would lose between $1.5 and $2 billion in annual revenue.

Instead, these determined illegals pushed out into remote desert areas to cross. While this is true, it does not necessarily provide a good historical example against the new wall. The fact that these walls and security efforts caused illegal immigrants to cross elsewhere at much greater risk to themselves (around 400 die annually crossing) seems to be a sign that these measures had a substantial deterrent impact.

It compares abortion to a situation in which a healthy woman (the mother by analogy) is attached to a dying patient (the fetus by analogy) in order to keep the dying patient alive. The concept is that the dying person does not have a right to the woman's body, and that the woman has a right to ""unplug"" (abort) even if it means the death of the other person. The problem with the analogy is many fold: 1. A woman and a fetus have a special relationship that is incomparable to that between a woman and a stranger or even a relative. There is a special biological drive inside the mother to keep the baby alive and a dependency by the baby on the mother. The mother, therefore, has a special responsibility to keep her child alive and not abort; 2. A woman often gives a form of tacit approval to the existence of a fetus in her womb: the act of engaging in sexual behavior; 3. abortion directly kills the embryo and does not merely ""unplug"" and let it die. These are critical differences that invalidate a classic, central argument for abortion.","64a4a7756d78b5cd5aed67628742c56f","df169cfcb89c8dec5ece06f7d36338bb"

Tangible proof of deterrence alone is not a valid reason for capital punishment (or any other form of punishment, for that matter), nor is it the main rationale employed by astute death penalty advocates. As Christian writer C.S. Lewis observes, '[deterrence] in itself, would be a very wicked thing to do. On the classical theory of punishment it was of course justified on the ground that the man deserved it. Why, in Heaven's name, am I to be sacrificed to the good of society in this way?-unless, of course, I deserve it.' Inflicting a penalty merely to deter -- rather than to punish for deeds done -- is the very definition of cruelty. A purely deterrent penalty is one where a man is punished -- not for something that he did -- but for something someone else might do. Lewis explained the logical end of this argument: 'If deterrence is all that matters, the execution of an innocent man, provided the public think him guilty, would be fully justified.'"" Men should be punished for their own crimes and not merely to deter others. That said, the death penalty undoubtedly does deter in some cases.

It's probable that it means the same thing earlier, when the citizens of Sodom ask Lot to bring out his guests so they may 'know' them. Lot accuses them of acting wickedly--an odd charge if all they meant is that they wanted to interrogate them to discover if they were spies. The biblical echoes of the Sodom story, furthermore, all clearly refer to sexual sin. Jeremiah 49:18 criticizes Jerusalem for its sexual sin, and says it is like Sodom. Ezekiel 16:49 is sometimes cited to prove that the sin of Sodom was only inhospitality. But the next verse says the residents of Sodom were destroyed because they did 'abominable things before me.'

The bombing was responsible for the deaths of about 200,000 people. But the US continued to intervene in Iraq and maintained sanctions under the pretense of forcing Saddam out of power. But these sanctions caused suffering on an enormous scale. Food and medicine was blocked and children starved to death and died from curable diseases and there was no clean up of depleted uranium which resulted in unparalleled cancer and leukemia epidemics. The sanctions were responsible for the deaths of about 1.5 million people by 1998, most of them children, according to US judge Ramsey Clark.

In many cases of so-called 'bad behavior', the child is simply responding in the only way he can, given his age and experience, to neglect of basic needs. Among these needs are: proper sleep and nutrition, treatment of hidden allergy, fresh air, exercise, and sufficient freedom to explore the world around him. But his greatest need is for his parents' undivided attention. In these busy times, few children receive sufficient time and attention from their parents, who are often too distracted by their own problems and worries to treat their children with patience and empathy. It is surely wrong and unfair to punish a child for responding in a natural way to having important needs neglected. For this reason, punishment is not only ineffective in the long run, it is also clearly unjust.","Con","Corporal punishment often over-responds to innocent child behavior","61e9353165dfa0ce43ba8f89d76806b9","57a8b07320a11834dce9eb4fc1c6d7ad"

Once a means test is introduced, it has to be administered and policed to detect the inevitable attempts at fraud, which is very expensive. A banded system is even worse, requiring a separate calculation to be made for every claimant, and for this to be redone every time their financial circumstances change. Furthermore, means testing will create perverse disincentives to work. When one's benefits end at a certain wage level, your tax rate on the extra dollar that pushes you into the next means-testing band can be more than 100%. This is because you can lose money on working when the cost of losing benefits outweighs the extra income received. In these situations, rational people will not work as much, leading to unemployment, loss of job skill development and a lack of confidence in the job seeker. Means testing can also lead to disincentives for saving and reduce income. In 2002, British Liberal Democrats and Conservatives joined to oppose the Labour government's move to expand means testing for pensioners on the grounds that poor people would lose any reason to save for their retirement. Means tested programmes have a special disincentive for those who can expect the most benefits because they feel they will be penalised for any savings they can scrape together. Means testing therefore provides no additional benefit to the poor but encourages irresponsible financial behaviour and a dependency culture.","Con","Universal benefits very efficient to deliver.","9d1a766039c3ea22943f82fd98fee6fa","60863b688c3b36dcec7f6eb09862250d"

Such a formula presupposes that Jerusalem is capable of a neat division. But it is not. Somehow, any separation of the city into component parts has to recognize that there are myriad economic and cultural links among political adversaries. Moreover, the monuments and shrines of the Old City attract visitors from all over the world: Muslims who want to worship at al-Aqsa Mosque; Jews seeking to pray at the Western Wall; Christians keen to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or follow the Stations of the Cross. Try as one might, it is not possible to count out the lanes of the Old City so that each of them is controlled by only one faith, one ethnicity. (Clinton proposed ""shared functional sovereignty"" for the Old City.)

Some cite this environment of constant observation as a panopticon, a “constant view of individuals through parasocietal mechanisms that influence behavior simply because of the possibility of being observed.” This environment of the constant potential for observation and surveillance dramatically effects behavior by making individuals constantly on-guard under the public observation glass. Yet, those that choose not to opt-out of ""news feed"" are not likely to consider the profound behavioral implications of these actions.

Drawing on recent research on human happiness, this Article argues that while wealthy nations are generally happier than their poorer counterparts, neither national nor individual economic growth appear to have an appreciable impact on the subjective well-being of the citizens of relatively wealthy nations. Significant causes of this finding include the problem of rivalry—that increases in the income of some depress the happiness of others—and the fact that individuals overestimate the degree to which additional consumption will improve their happiness. Studies show the level of inequality in a society also may affect levels of happiness. Ultimately, happiness research is consistent with the strongest justification for adopting a progressive tax structure—income has declining marginal utility thus redistribution can increase total welfare in a society.","Pro","Progressive taxation fosters greater happiness in society","974f2c25599eeaba4f17b3438ddddb10","861c1355602e3dc668f9b134bb8c2624"
